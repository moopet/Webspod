WWWSpod installation instructions
---------------------------------

Requirements:
A web server running with PHP4.
An installation directory that allows execution of cgi programs.
A writable temporary directory .
A c compiler.

Compatibility:
WWWSpod has only been tested on my debian 3 system running Apache 1.3 with
mod_php. It is known to work in IE6+ and Mozilla 6+. Other browsers haven't
been fully tested yet.

Installation:
Copy the install files into a subfolder of your document root. 
Then edit config.h and config.php as all the user-configurable options
are there. You must make sure the temporary directory specified in
TEMP_PATH exists and is writable by the user your webserver runs as.

Just run make to compile everything.

If you want to see who's logged in from a command prompt, well, the easiest
way at the moment is to use the console command included, wsctl. Use
'wsctl --help' for more options.

The first time you browse to webspod, it will warn you that a talker list file
doesn't exist and attempt to grab it automatically from http://list.ewtoo.org
This may also happen when the system is rebooted (since most systems will
wipe /tmp at boot time, which is the default location for the list file)
If it can't download this file, you can copy the included sample file 
(webspod~talkers) which will probably be out of date, but is easy enough to
edit, as it's plain text.

<h3>Overview:</h3>
Webspod is an HTML interface for connecting to talkers. You run it on a webserver and then browse to it to spod. It is free software, released under the GNU General Public License, the details of which can be found <a href="COPYING"> here</a>.
<br/>
It was written from scratch by Ben Sinclair (moopet) and is copyright &copy; 2003. It bears similarities to other web connection interfaces (balloon's HTMLCon which can be found at <a href="http://www.caves.uk.net">caves.uk.net</a> and the Uberworld webclient from <a href="http://www.uberworld.org">uberworld.org</a>)
<br/>
It can be started directly from your own webpage. Here is an <a href="example.html">example page</a>.

<h3>Screenshots:</h3>
<ul>
<li>connecting to Caves using the aqua theme: <a href="screenshots.php?file=screenshot1.jpg">800x640 jpeg</a></li>

</ul>

<a name="features"></a>
<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Supports scriptable, stylesheet-based "themes" including sounds.</li>
<li>Optionally converts ASCII smilies to graphical icons.</li>
<li>Optionally timestamps every line received from the talker.</li>
<li>Optionally echoes user input to the main window.</li>
<li>Optionally converts IRC-commands to ew-too style commands on-the-fly.</li>
<li>Access to all options is available through the transparently embedded console.</li>
<li>Complete self-contained client, allows disconnection and reconnection to other hosts.</li>
<li>Auto-highlights any embedded URLs.</li>
<li>Multi-session safe (multiple tabs in mozilla work great too!)</li>
<li>Includes easy provision for hard-coding talker address into the cgi</li>
<li>Can extract current talker addresses and details from <a href="http://list.ewtoo.org">list.ewtoo.org</a></li>
<li>Can look up players' profiles on <a href="http://spodlist.org">spodlist.org</a></li>
<li>Includes a comprehensive debugging mode.</li>
</ul>
<br/>


<a name="benefits"></a>
<h3>Benefits:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Allows spods to connect to talkers from behind facist firewalls.</li>
<li>Allows partial connection to talkers via SSL if the webserver is running it.</li>
</ul>
<br/>


<a name="drawbacks"></a>
<h3>Drawbacks:</h3>
<ul>
<li>It's still quite beta.</li>
<li>It uses a lot of non-standard HTML tricks to make things work.</li>
<li>Though it'll work if your firewall allows outbound web requests, it almost certainly won't work through web proxy servers.</li>
<li>Webspod is itself a proxy service. Every connection routed through webspod will appear to be coming from the same IP, that of the server. This could give the talker's admin a headache for sitebans, etc.</li>
<li>Each connection will launch a new task on the server Currently this eats up about 55k or memory per connection :(</li>
<li>ident will not be provided from the user's local machine, and if identd is running on the server hosting webspod,
all talkers will get will be something like "www-data".</li>
<li>Players must trust the service hosting site not to harvest passwords as all text is processed by these CGIs.</li>
<li>Might make your web server's access logs a bit hefty.</li>
</ul>
<br/>


<a name="wishlist"></a>
<h3>Wishlist:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.w3c.org">W3C</a> compliance.</li>
<li>better documentation :)</li>
<li>Command history (like the uberworld/CGI:IRC clients)</li>
<li>email address highlighting.</li>
<li>More, better, themes.</li>
<li>Non-JavaScript reliant version that works in lynx/links.</li>
<li>stealth command support.</li>
<li>personal message windows.</li>
<li>Save last talker in a cookie.</li>
<li>Macros :)</li>
</ul>
<br/>


<a name="bugs"></a>
<h3>Known bugs:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mozilla doesn't always play sounds properly.</li>
<li>IE doesn't correctly render the javascript for opening a window with "/clone".</li>
<li>ident checking is currently disabled due to hanging on some people's connections.</li>
<li>Some stylesheets including bitmap backgrounds slow the interface down unacceptably.</li>
<li>In mozilla, especially, the service slows down after a couple of hours due to the streamed page getting stupidly large.</li>
<li>Ewe-editor mode is pretty shoddy.</li>
<li>Doesn't forward unknown console commands to the talker in IRC emulation mode.</li>
<li>Sometimes doesn't scroll the last line output.</li>
<li>Aqua theme is broken slightly due to different renderings in different browsers.</li>
<li>Sometimes it doesn't keep receiving data from the talker without hitting enter a lot???</li>
<li>Auto-focus script puts cursor at start of command.</li>
<li>Sometimes it disconnects from a talker immediately after opening the port.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<li>Added an error page for if you click connect and don't have a browser that does JavaScript.</li>

<li>Removed "webshell" mode. That may well become a seperate project, a bit like <a href="http://www.port42.com">port42</a>.
<li>Made the static HTML pages and stylesheets <a href="http://www.w3c.org">W3C</a> compliant. This is currently impossible with the dynamic content.</li>
